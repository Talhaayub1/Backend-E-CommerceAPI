## üöÄ Getting Started
### Setup:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies with your package manager (like npm or yarn).
3. Run the server and ensure it works at `http://localhost:5000`.
4. Use Postman or another API testing tool to interact with the API endpoints.

## üìÑ Documentation

## Project Deployment
The E-Commerce API is hosted at [Render URL](https://node-course-e-commerce.onrender.com/).

## üíª Backend Setup
### Express Server
1. Import express and set the server port to 5000.
2. Connect to the database with environment variables for MongoDB.
3. Set up routes and middleware, including error handling.

### User Authentication
1. Implement JWT for token-based authentication.
2. Set up routes for user registration, login, and logout.
3. Implement middleware for user authentication and authorization.

### Product Management
1. Create a product model with properties like name, price, description, etc.
2. Implement CRUD operations for products.
3. Implement routes for product management, with appropriate middleware for user roles.

### Order Handling
1. Create an order model with properties for tax, shipping fee, subtotal, etc.
2. Implement CRUD operations for orders.
3. Implement routes for order handling, with authentication middleware.

### Review Management
1. Create a review model with properties like rating, title, comment, etc.
2. Implement CRUD operations for reviews.
3. Implement routes for review handling, with authentication middleware.

### Additional Features
1. Implement virtuals and population for related data.
2. Integrate security packages like `express-rate-limiter`, `helmet`, `express-mongo-sanitize`, and `cors`.

## üöÄ Deployment and Hosting
### üõ†Ô∏è Deployment on Render
1. **Create an Account**: Set up a Render account and link it to your GitHub repository.
2. **Set Up Web Service**: Create a new Web Service in Render, connecting it to your GitHub repository.
3. **Configure Environment Variables**: Set up variables in the Render dashboard, like `MONGO_URL` for your database connection and other necessary values.
4. **Deploy Your Application**: Deploy your app on Render. Render will automatically detect your project setup and deploy it using the given configurations.

### üìå Important Notes for Render Deployment
- Ensure your `package.json` is properly configured with a "start" script that starts your server.
- If using external services (like databases), make sure the connections are set up properly and securely.
- Render handles deployments automatically, but you can manually trigger deployments through the Render dashboard.
